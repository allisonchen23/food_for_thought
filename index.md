Welcome to my blog! Currently, I'm just writing about the projects I've been working on for the summer of 2019 at the Field Museum in Chicago, IL. I hope it's coherent enough for people to follow, but in the future, I'd like to blog more about other topics I enjoy such as art, exercise, and nutrition! Enjoy!
