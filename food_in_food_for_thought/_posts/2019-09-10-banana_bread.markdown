### Instructions

#### Making Oat Flour

As a general rule of thumb, oat flour can substitute regular flour! Just be careful because the oats tend to absorb liquid a lot quicker than all purpose flour, so some modifications may have to be made. If a recipe asks for 1 cup of all purpose flour, you can blend 1 1/4 cups of oats to make approximately 1 cup of oat flour.

1. Pour your oats in a blender or food processor (I personally prefer a blender!)
2. Start on a low speed and gradually bring your blender to high speed
3. Blend/Process oats until it is a fine flour (approximately 30 seconds) 
4. Shake it around a bit to make sure there are no large chunks of oats that got left behind

#### Rest of Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F
2. Using an electric beater (or whisk and a really strong arm), cream together the oil and brown sugar
2. Add vanilla and eggs and beat until consistent
3. In a separate bowl, combine the dry ingredients
4. Alternate adding the dry ingredients with adding the mashed bananas and milk into the liquids. You can use a rubber spatula to mix at this point
5. Grease your breadpan using just a little bit of olive oil (just enough to cover the inside surfaces)
6. Pour your batter and place in the oven for around 45 minutes to an hour. I'll generally set an initial timer to 35 minutes and check on it periodically.
* Note: if you're using a pan with a wider base, I would check on it more often.
7. Let it cool for around 20 minutes, and if you aren't serving it right away, cover with alumnium foil to avoid the bread from drying out. 
8. Enjoy! :D

#### So Why Oat Flour?

The reason I prefer to use oat flour boils down to how the grain is processed to make regular flour. The grain in all purpose flour is processed in a way that it loses most of its nutrients and fiber. Oats, on the other hand, are considered a whole grain which means it goes through less processing and holds onto most of its fiber and nutrients. This not only provides important nutrients to your body, but also can help keep you full for longer! Whole wheat flour has similar properties to making oat flour, but it tends to be a little more expensive. Using just a blender or food processor, you can ensure you're giving your body the nutrients you need without spending too much!
