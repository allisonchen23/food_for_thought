<p>This morning, Beth came to the Field Museum to work with me on implementing stratified cross validation and ROC testing. Stratified cross validation essentially partitions the data into groups of approximately equal distributions of each class. ROC (stand for Receiving Operator Curve) is a type of graph that can help us quantify how “good” our model is. It uses the percentage of true positives and false positives and the closer the curve hugs the y-axis, the more confident it is. Take a look at the image below:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/ROC_curve.png" alt="ROC Curve" class="images half" /></p>

<p>The straight line represents if it were just up to chance, so if the ROC curve is close to that, it’s bad.</p>

<p>I got the code to run with stratified cross validation and creating an ROC curve at the end with small amounts of bogus test data, but when I tried to import larger amounts of useful data, the program seems to be crashing and I’m not sure why. I ran the old model again (prior to implementing cross validation) and it seemed to work okay, but in this new script, it feels like everything’s falling apart (rip). Before the program started crashing, it would train but ridiculously overfit on the training data while validation accuracy didn’t increase at all :(</p>

<p>I’m trying to see if I accidentally changed something when adapting the model, but then the code crashed entirely, freezing the computer.</p>

<p>This is definitely a rough note to end the day on, but I’m going to try not to let it bother me too much and come in tomorrow ready to problem solve!</p>

<p>This morning, I was able to fix why the code would crash my computer! When I was using the split function on the stratifiedKFold object and accessing features and labels that made up the training and validation sets, they had to be numpy arrays. My labels data structure was only a list and thus would throw an error and crash it. After making a few more tweaks on random seeds and epochs, aroudn 10:30 AM I started running the 10 fold cross validation and it hasn’t stopped since. I’ve left it on and hope no one messes with it! Tomorrow morning, we’ll be able to check out results and see what changes we can make to improve the model.</p>

<p>While the model was training, I was tasked with a side task. There’s a bryophyte checklist of the Java region that’s written as a word document. We want to parse the document and store the genus, species, and founder into a CSV. Currently, I’m using a package called python-docx and basic python string manipulation to parse out the desired information. The only downside is this code I’m writing is only specific to this document which of course isn’t as fun in CS.</p>

<p>Have a great day!</p>

<p>-Al</p>
