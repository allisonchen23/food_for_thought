&lt;p&gt;Cook Time: 8 to 25, depending on what we’re roasting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serves: 3-4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Includes instructions for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almonds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pecans&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walnuts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Butternut squash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zucchini &amp;amp; summer squash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Broccoli &amp;amp; cauliflower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;difficulty&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- ![Roasted Everything](/food_for_thought/assets/images/blog/food/recipes/breakfast_wrap/header_photo.jpg){:class=&quot;images half main_img&quot;} --&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whatever you’re roasting (the base)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optional spices (salt &amp;amp; pepper, for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toss your base with the olive oil and spices in a bowl until the base is just covered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On a baking sheet, place down some parchment paper or aluminum foil and spread out your base&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place in oven at specified temperature for [time interval 1], then mix it around a bit and leave it in the oven for [time interval 2]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to the tables below for proportions, oven temperatures, and durations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;nuts&quot;&gt;Nuts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always do approximately 2 cups of nuts with 1 TBSP of olive oil, no spices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Nut&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Temperature (F)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Time Interval 1 (minutes)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Time Interval 2 (minutes)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Almonds&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;350&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Pecans&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;325&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5-6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Walnuts&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;350&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;vegetables&quot;&gt;Vegetables&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d do approximately 3-4 cups of veggies with 1.5 TBSP olive oil, with salt and pepper.
With roasting veggies, the rule of thumb is higher temperature for vegetables with more water!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Veggie&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Temperature (F)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Time Interval 1 (minutes)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Time Interval 2 (minutes)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Butternut Squash&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;400&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10-12&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10-12&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Zucchini &amp;amp; Summer Squash&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;450&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10-12&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10-12&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Broccoli &amp;amp; Cauliflower&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;425&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10-12&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10-12&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roasted nuts for me are a perfect snack and addition for when I make my homemade granola! Feel free to find your own spice recipes and play around with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roasted veggies are perfect for meal prepping! It’s very little effort to make, and while they’re roasting, you can do literally whatever you need to. They’re a perfect addition to quinoa bowls, salads, and rice bowls!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Protein (I normally use something like a sliced boiled egg, fried egg, or smoked salmon)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hummus&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and of course, veggies! Such as:
    &lt;ul&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;handful of arugula, spinach, or mixed greens&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really love this for breakfast for a few reasons! First, there’s hummus so that automatically makes it a million times better. Second, although there’s not a lot of calories, this wrap always keeps me really filled. &lt;strong&gt;HOLD UP&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not saying that it’s healthy because there are not a lot of calories. Just for me personally as a small human being, I don’t need to consume that many calories to function, so this is a perfect way for me not to overeat. If you are more active or above the height of 5’1-and-three-quarters” you can definitely satiate yourself with this wrap by using a flour, corn, or chickpea tortillas, adding more protein, or pairing it with some oatmeal or fruit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think vegetables is always something we can eat more of, and this wrap is a perfect way to incorporate it into your breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s really easy to &lt;strong&gt;meal prep&lt;/strong&gt; this by cutting up the vegetables (except the avocado) beforehand and putting them in jars. Since they’re just veggies they can definitely last all week long, making mornings really easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, these are all relative ish! Adapt as you wish!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3/4 cup of add ins (such as mixed nuts, dried fruit, shredded coconut, seeds)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 1/2 cups oats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/6 cup honey and 1/6 cup nut butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For looser granola, decrease the amount of honey and nut butter you use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the add-ins in a mixing bowl, pour the oats on top, and gently mix.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combine the honey and nut butter in a small bowl and microwave for around 20-30 seconds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir the honey/nut butter mixture well and pour half into the mixing bowl. Use a rubber spatula to try to fold in and mix well while breaking up any large chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour in the rest of the honey/nut butter mixture and continue stirring/folding. Ideally, you want all the oats to be covered at least a little and if you press firmly with the rubber spatula, the oats should stick together a little.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet (covered with parchment paper) and spread it out to be a little less than a centimeter thick. Gently press it flat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the granola bake for around 8 minutes. When it jus starts to get light brown, stir the granola around and firmly pack the granola into a flat sheet again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now be careful! Granola burns very easily!&lt;/strong&gt; Leave the granola in the oven for another 3-5 minutes or until the top is light and golden. The edges should be a few shades darker of brown.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take out the granola and let it cool. You will be &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; tempted to eat it right now but restrain yourself!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the granola has completely cooled, take a spatula and break it up into large chunks and place everything in an airtight container. The larger chunks are perfect for snacking and the small pieces that break off are ideal for those morning yogurt parfaits :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-do-i-love-granola&quot;&gt;Why do I love granola?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell from my recipes, I’m a huge fan of oats! They’re unprocessed whole wheats, which in general mean that they take longer for your body to break down and provide your body with energy in a more stable manner, meaning less spikes in glucose levels. Plus granola is an amazing add-on for yogurt bowls in the morning and the light afternoon pick-me-up snack. And by making your own granola at home, you can control how much sugar/sweetener goes into it as well as the ratio of everything. Honestly though, this granola always gets demolished by my parents, if I’m not looking, it’ll all be gone within a few days!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

It’s been a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long time since I’ve updated this, so I think we can safely say it’s been a busy quarter. I finished my finals yesterday (woo! freedom!) and today as I was on my way to LAX to fly back to Chicago, I was inspired to write a blog post about this after having a wonderful conversation with my Lyft driver. I know the title of this post is ‘Talk to Your Uber Driver’, but ‘Talk to Your Ride Share Driver’ just didn’t have the same ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow at school, I’m known to be relatively outgoing, and I tend to find it less difficult to strike up a conversation in the dining halls or elevator. (I really don’t mean for this to sound like a flex or anything, I promise this is relevant), and when some people ask my how I developed this skill, my honest answer is &lt;strong&gt;talk to your Uber driver&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually this is responded with a light laughter then awkward silence when they realize I’m serious. Let’s think about it for a second! First, you’ll probably never see the driver again, so what’s the worst that could happen? You have an awkward 20 minute drive and then you both completely forget about each other and no harm no foul. But what’s the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; that could happen? You get offered a job (which actually has happened to a good friend of mine)! But all joking aside, the most common outcome is that you get to talk to someone completely new with a totally different perspective on life, and at the end of the drive you leave the car wondering how time flew by so quickly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can’t take credit for this idea; it was actually suggested to me by one of my good friends Matthew Wang (check out &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; website &lt;span class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://matthewwang.me/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;) who is always able to strike up a conversation with our Uber drivers and I’m happy I get to learn from him :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, there hasn’t ever been a time that I regretted talking to my Uber driver, but each time, I learn a unique story of how they got to where they are today! It’s really eye opening for me to talk to people from backgrounds that are really diffrent from mine. Personally, I think it helps me see that there’s not one correct path to live life and “be successful”. I’m meeting all these people who are pursuing their passions and finding fulfillment in their lives despite barriers. I truly believe everyone has a unique and amazing story that tells who they are and how they got to where they are today, and I really love to just sit and listen to my Uber drivers share their stories and passions with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially because each and every Uber driver is different, striking up a conversation with each one helps me  learn how to connect with different people. As an extreme example, you probably don’t talk to you grandparents the same way you talk to your best friends, and although the differences are more nuanced from driver to driver, a similar concept applies. It’s about learning how to pick up different almost “talking strategies” that allow you to have engaging conversations with almost anyone. I’ll be honest though, most of the time it’s simply finding a topic that the other person is passionate about and from there, just let the conversation flow :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my LA Uber/Lyft experiences, I’ve met some amazing and really memorable people, such as a guy who’s opening up his own Brazilian Jiu Jitsu studio, a comedian who’s performed for Navy Seals, and one guy in a VR startup who actually also got his current job from driving someone in his Uber. I’ve also had just some amazing conversations such as mine today where we talked about things like the development of social media and the oil/energy industry. It was amazing to me to be able to talk about such important topics with someone I had just met, and I definitely left feeling refreshed from hearing someone else’s opinion and thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not saying to go and pour out your whole life story to the Uber driver (first, that would be weird and second, please think about your personal safety!) but it doesn’t hurt to try to strike up a conversation starting with some small talk. Remember, still be safe and avoid oversharing; if things start to take a turn south, please be careful and use your discretion on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are days where I’m just utterly exhausted and can’t keep up a conversation for my life, or sometimes the driver is just not reciprocating the conversation. That’s okay! Like I said in the beginning, you’ll get out of the car 20 minutes later and you and the driver will probably both forget each other. But tl;dr to this post, using Lyfts and Ubers as opportunities to learn about someone new and develop interpersonal skills is something that I have found personally rewarding and hope you all can give it a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wishing you all the best and happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not sure if it’s because the environment is just completely different or because I myself am a different person too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I come to UCLA, I tend to lose contact with people from home, even my family, which I know is definitely not right. I want to keep in touch and all, but I tend to get so caught up in the moment with academics and living in the present that it tends to slip my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then this summer, when I went home, I felt the exact opposite! I was able to reconnect with people from home, but I felt I could’ve been better with keeping in touch with my friends from school. Maybe I just need to live in the moment less and remember to keep the people I love and care about close to me, even if they’re a few hundred miles away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can anyone else relate?&lt;/p&gt;

I talked to my mom a lot about it and from her, realized that working effectively with people is probably one of the hardest things we have to learn to do. It’s not something you can only read from a textbook and understand immediately; it takes many experiences and practice to learn how to work with people without offending or hurting anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we’ve all been in a situation where a disagreement arises, but we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; we’re right. How can we lead the other person to reach our conclusion? From experience, you probably know that fighting and arguing usually leads to nowhere, but too often, we let our emotions get the best of us. We don’t always do what’s rational or expected, which is part of what makes us human! Going back to the question, however, how can we guide people to our point of view?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I’m reading the infamous book &lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em&gt; by Dale Carnegie (which was written back in 1936) and it brings up fair points on this exact issue. To be honest, I do feel the wording of the title could be changed, it already seems a little ingenuine! Anyways, Carnegie delineates that we of course want to avoid arguing at all costs. In the case there is a disagreement, however, he mentions to stay calm, listen to the other person, and ask questions (kind of like Socrates!). Additionally, it may help to start the conversation with a totally different topics, such as one the other person genuinely cares about, to “warm them up”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques seem fine and dandy, but for me, they bring up the question of genuinity. Is it right to intentionally talk about something you &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; this other person will like? To be the devil’s advocate here, it seems like the book is suggesting you bring up a topic that you may not be genuinely interested in, but you feign it to get that person to like you more and be more willing to listen to you. I definitely understand that if you can connect with someone personally, even if there is a disagreement, they will be more likely to listen to your ideas. However, is your intention with this simply to get what you want or to actually understand this other person and their interests? Perhaps I’m thinking too far into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another section of the book mentions how if you know you’re in the wrong, to bring it up before the other person does and in a way that they can feel like they’re showing you mercy. For example, if you get pulled over for speeding, instead of trying to fight the cop or giving excuses on why you were speeding, Carnegie suggests that if you admit to what you did and almost in a pleading manner, the police is more likely to be lenient. This is because of people’s desire to have their ego boosted. If you fought the cop on this, denying that you should get ticketed, the cop may feel like his/her authority is being tested and fight back. Everyone wants to feel important and by insisting to give you a ticket you don’t want, the cop can feel important. On the other hand, if you admit you’re wrong, the cop is unable to argue with that and in order to feel important, he/she may show mercy and let you go. (Obviously, this is not saying that if you get pulled over and try this tactic it will work, it’s just an example very similar to one Carnegie outlines in the book.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again to me, it seems a little excessive and almost manipulative to intentionally grovel just because you think you can get out of a ticket or a consequence. I agree with admitting when you’re wrong, but I believe there are better ways to do it… This to me just seems like the other end of the spectrum than arguing incessantly and allowing your temper to take over, and I personally think I’d feel more comfortable with an approach in the middle: staying calm and admitting if you’re wrong but not to the point of groveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me in all of this, I think it goes back to the intentions. If your intentions are to avoid conflict, I think actions similar to the two outlined above may be okay. But if your intentions are solely to get exactly what you want and you implement the techniques above, that’s where the line blurs a little.  But then again, can you always tell what someone’s intentions are? I myself am still trying to develop my own stance on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I recommend this book! &lt;em&gt;How to Win Friend and Influence People&lt;/em&gt; by Dale Carnegie. I think there are insightful things and great personal examples in the book, but I also think simply following his steps are not enough and as a reader, you should think about each one pretty carefully. They’ve got to be internalized for each person and there has to be genuine concern and care in the actions (that’s the tough part!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just some topics to reflect on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you tend to resolve conflict and settle disagreements? Do they normally end positively?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can you be genuine about your actions/intent in every day situations?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you have a technique that helps you work well with people? I’d love to hear about it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-oat-flour&quot;&gt;Making Oat Flour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule of thumb, oat flour can substitute regular flour! Just be careful because the oats tend to absorb liquid a lot quicker than all purpose flour, so some modifications may have to be made. If a recipe asks for 1 cup of all purpose flour, you can blend 1 1/4 cups of oats to make approximately 1 cup of oat flour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour your oats in a blender or food processor (I personally prefer a blender!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start on a low speed and gradually bring your blender to high speed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blend/Process oats until it is a fine flour (approximately 30 seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shake it around a bit to make sure there are no large chunks of oats that got left behind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rest-of-instructions&quot;&gt;Rest of Instructions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat the oven to 350F and lightly grease a loaf pan with olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a large mixing bowl, mash banans with a fork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whisk in the greek yogurt, honey, and vanilla&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beat in the eggs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gradually pour and mix the dry ingredients into the banana mixture&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for approximately 40-55 minutes (until a toothpick stuck in the middle comes out clean)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enjoy! :D&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-why-oat-flour&quot;&gt;So Why Oat Flour?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I prefer to use oat flour boils down to how the grain is processed to make regular flour. The grain in all purpose flour is processed in a way that it loses most of its nutrients and fiber. Oats, on the other hand, are considered a whole grain which means it goes through less processing and holds onto most of its fiber and nutrients. This not only provides important nutrients to your body, but also can help keep you full for longer! Whole wheat flour has similar properties to making oat flour, but it tends to be a little more expensive. Using just a blender or food processor, you can ensure you’re giving your body the nutrients you need without spending too much!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Prep Time: 15 minutes</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Eat to Beat Disease: a MUST READ</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/food_for_thought/eat-to-beat-disease/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Eat to Beat Disease: a MUST READ" /><published>2019-09-05T08:25:40-05:00</published><updated>2019-09-05T08:25:40-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/food_for_thought/eat-to-beat-disease</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/food_for_thought/eat-to-beat-disease/">&lt;p&gt;The other day I was at the library, looking for a quick read before I head off to school in a week, and I spotted a thick book with color foods on the front titled &lt;em&gt;Eat to Beat Disease&lt;/em&gt;. ‘This sounds interesting!’ I thought to myself, and as I was in a hurry to leave, I quickly checked it out. That night, I started reading after dinner and literally could not stop. This book is everything I’ve been looking for! And I’m not exaggerating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/food_for_thought/assets/images/blog/food/eat_to_beat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Selfie with my favorite new book&quot; class=&quot;images third&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Here it is! My favorite new read&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, I wanted a resource (a collection of journal articles, podcasts, book, &lt;em&gt;anything!&lt;/em&gt;) that explained why some foods are healthy and others aren’t with scientific backing, and this book &lt;span class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt;does it all&lt;/span&gt;. It explains why certain foods are good for you beyond the scope of how full it makes you or whether the calories are “worth it”. In fact, I’m currently about halfway through the book, and the author, Dr. William Li, has barely even talked about calories! WAKE UP AMERICA! Calories are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the only measure of health!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a quick sneak peek, Dr. Li first explains five of the body’s amazing defense mechanisms against diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and many others that seem to only be treatable by modern medicine. The five mechanisms are summarized as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Angiogenesis: building blood vessels to various parts of the body&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regeneration: using stem cells to repair injuries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our gut’s microbiome: the good bacteria living inside of us&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNA Projection and Repair: affecting expression of certain genes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immunity: using our immune system to build resistance against certain diseases/invaders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except, read the book for a much more thorough and in depth explanation of the mechanisms; this is barely the tip of the iceberg! Then, Dr. Li goes on to explain which foods affect each of the five mechanisms and guess what! They’re mostly foods that you’re probably already eating! He backs up each food listed with scientific evidence, whether from clinical trials or experiments done in a lab setting, and usually uses more than 1 experiment as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me personally, before picking up this book, I kind of judged foods on if they were healthy or not based on if they had a lot of fiber and would fill me up while minimizing the number of calories I consumed. However, this is such a black and white scale for a field as colorful as a rainbow, almost literally! There’s so much more to health than just digestion rate. For example, it’s known that cheese is pretty calorie/energy dense and contains quite a bit of saturated fat, so I tended to avoid it as much as I can. However, cheese (especially European cheese) has a lot of probiotics and prebiotics (good bacteria and food for the bacteria in our microbiome, respectively) that will improve our overall health! In moderation, of course, cheese is really beneficial!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m already looking at the foods I eat and making a mental note of which defense mechanism I’m improving by eating this, but the list is so long, I’ll definitely have to give &lt;em&gt;Eat to Beat Disease&lt;/em&gt; another read to understand more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As summer turns into Fall and we’re stuck inside anyways, &lt;strong&gt;definitely&lt;/strong&gt; put this on your read list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: it is a little scientifically dense, and while Dr. Li does a great job of explaining it, if a concept is new, don’t be afraid to re-read a part a few times or use Google! I know I definitely did :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay that’s a tough question. Sugar by itself is not necessarily bad; it’s a good source of quick energy for our bodies. &lt;em&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/em&gt;, too much sugar, especially in its most processed form can be pretty detrimental to our bodies and lead to weight gain as well as medical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-does-our-body-digest-sugar&quot;&gt;How does our body digest sugar?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, sugar will be broken down to glucose, which is the form of energy our cells require, and the glucose gets sent to one of three places:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our cells, to give them energy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our liver, to store glucose for later in the form of glycogen (which you don’t need to worry about)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our adipose tissue as fat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our cells prefer to have sugar because they can quickly be broken down into glucose, but our cells can only take so much glucose at a time. Same with our liver. The first two have a capacity of how much glucose gets sent there, but adipose tissue &lt;span class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt; can take as much glucose as it wants&lt;/span&gt;. That’s where the dangerous part is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our body breaks down too much sugar at once and has too much glucose for our cells and liver, it will send all the excess glucose to turn into fat, which will lead to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;so-we-should-avoid-all-sugar&quot;&gt;So we should avoid all sugar?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily! The main difference in sugar that is, for example, added in candy and sodas, and sugars in whole fruit is the magical thing called &lt;span class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt; fiber&lt;/span&gt;. The sugars in fruit are all encased by a lot of fiber, which if you recall, slows down the digestion of food. This means that the sugar in fruit gets slowly broken down and transported to the appropriate location over a longer period of time. If you ate a candy bar, on the other hand, basically all that sugar gets broken down to glucose and taken to the appropriate destination all at once. Sugars in fruit are able to provide your &lt;em&gt;cells&lt;/em&gt; with a more constant form of energy, which also helps you feel fuller and maintain energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, fiber is actually the main difference between white sugar and brown sugar. Although brown sugar is not the same as the sugar we get in whole fruits, it has more fiber compared to white sugar, and thus is marketed as healthier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-do-we-know-what-has-added-sugar&quot;&gt;How do we know what has added sugar?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah yes this can be the tricky one. The first place I would check is the nutrition label. Under ‘sugar’, some labels have a row for ‘added sugar’ which is not very desirable. However, for a more thorough check, you must go to the ingredient list. &lt;span class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt;But sugar is tricky.&lt;/span&gt; After people realized sugar was leading to weight gain and other health complications, many companies became sly about hiding sugar into their products by using different names for sugar but in reality, it just means ‘Added Sugar’. Some common ones to look out for are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mono and disaccharides (dextrose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, and sucrose)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cane sugar, evaporated cane juice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High Fructose Corn Syrup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Corn syrup solids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dextrin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Glucose syrup solids&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maltodextrin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agave Nectar/Syrup (very similar to honey)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;im-never-eating-sweets-again-right&quot;&gt;I’m never eating sweets again, right?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say enjoy in moderation! It’s very difficult to cut out something entirely from your diet because you’ll probably start to crave it even more, causing a binge eating session. It’s okay to enjoy that sweetness of a candy bar or ice cream once in a while, but be mindful of what’s happening inside your body after you eat it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="nutrition" /><summary type="html">All sugar is bad right?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 9: Wrapping Things Up!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/food_for_thought/FM-week-9/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 9: Wrapping Things Up!" /><published>2019-08-26T20:31:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-08-26T20:31:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/food_for_thought/week-9</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/food_for_thought/FM-week-9/">&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday-august-26-2019&quot;&gt;Monday August 26, 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday! This past weekend was so relaxing! It was kind of hard to get up for work today haha. And I faced a bit of a surprise when I arrived at the museum because my badge didn’t work anymore! I was supposed to end the internship last week, but we extended it for one week and we didn’t let Access Control know… oopsies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all fixed now, don’t worry :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that mini roadblock, I continued to examine the models and make changes to improve them. In my model training to find the differences between Lycopodium and Selaginella, some folds did really well and training accuracy reached 90% while validation accuracy lagged behind, but in other folds, the training &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; validation accuracy both plummeted to around 50% by the 10-15 epoch and just couldn’t recoveer. In all epochs, however, loss was constantly decreasing. I’m not really sure what’s happening there and why it would happen on some folds and not others… maybe there’s a few images that are just really throwing the model off? Although I did look through them manually before. Perhaps it’s worth another look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first looked into doing image augmentation, but I originally thought that it would result in the model training on &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; images than you have every epoch. Turns out, it just trains on a smaller sample, but each epoch it uses &lt;em&gt;randomly altered&lt;/em&gt; images that are different to the model. It may be useful in another application (like the frullania), but currently when we have so many images already, I don’t think we need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried playing around with the regularizers today in the Dense and Convolutional-2D (Conv2D) layers, but most combinations I tried resulted in the model overfitting very early and the training and validation accuracy would begin to decrease by the 6-7th epoch. (To see what changes I made, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15972K_rdv3zpnvnV--wSaTpiK0jnVDkBzhUWjre5BLg/edit?usp=sharing&amp;quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt;this doc&lt;/a&gt;. The model started to learn again pretty well when I kept activity regularizers in the Dense layers, despite there not being an exact equivalent in the Smithsonian Methematica Model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll see what happens tomorrow morning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Al&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS, Matt wants me to try running the model again on the two frullania species again but the images being from farther away. I want to look into bootstrapping for this and hopefully synthetically expand our data set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday-august-28-2019&quot;&gt;Tuesday, August 28, 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing this morning, I checked on the training of the model on Lycopodium and Selaginella. For the most part, it was okay; there was still a bit of overfitting, but the trend of validation accuracy seemed to follow training accuracy, like in the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/food_for_thought/assets/images/blog/fm/val_accuracy_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Slightly overfit accuracy&quot; class=&quot;images half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, on other folds, we got something disastrous like this:
&lt;img src=&quot;/food_for_thought/assets/images/blog/fm/val_accuracy_8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dropped accuracy&quot; class=&quot;images half&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not entirely sure why on most folds, the model seems to be training well, while on others, it’s completely unable to after a certain amount of time. I don’t think it’s overfitting because even the training accuracy decreased. Well, tomorrow, I’m meeting with Dr. Iacobelli, the computer science professor at Northeastern Illinois University, so hopefully he’ll be able to offer more insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I received new images of the frullania species today. These ones are more zoomed in and hopefully will allow the model to pick up on more details in the differences between the two plants. I implemented some bootstrapping to train the model because we only had a little less than 300 images which I’m not sure is enough to be able to completely train the model on. I left it going overnight, so I’ll be able to check in on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, most of my big machine learning changes are wrapping up and I’ve been working on documentation, documentation, and documentation! Especially since I was pretty much the only one working on this project this summer, it’s &lt;strong&gt;extremely&lt;/strong&gt; important that someone could study my work for a bit and pick up where I left off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Al&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday-august-28-2019&quot;&gt;Wednesday August 28, 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I met with Dr. Iacobelli, Beth, and Dr. Campbell (unfortunately Matt coudln’t make it) We updated Dr. Iacobelli and here are his responses/advice. Regarding the random dropped accuracy I wrote about yesterday, he recommends that we meticulously check the code first. There may a bug (such as divide by 0) that’s throwing everything off. Additionally, it simply may be lack of processing power in the computer causing a data overflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing he noticed is that the images we’re using from the Field Musuem are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; consistent in the herbarium sheet layout. Some have labels in the upper right corner, some are lower left, some have specimen in the middle, some have specimen in the lower right corner. The inconsistencies in layout may be providing too much noise for the model, so he recommends that we try a smaller sample of images that have a more consistent layout an see if there is an improvement in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is a computer at NEIU with 64 GB RAM that Beth is going to be trying our model with the Smithsonian images (which I didn’t know we had!) and we found out there is a computer at the museum with &lt;span class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt; one terabyte of RAM. I repeat, of RAM. &lt;/span&gt; I almost fainted when I heard that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I’m wrapping up this week, I’m excited for Beth to be able to try things out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Al&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday-august-29-2019&quot;&gt;Thursday August 29, 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came in this morning, the model that was training on images of the Adiantum and Blechnum genera finished training, so I created a script to test it. Since the model really consists of 10 trained models (given that we used 10 fold cross validation), I had to take that into account. One way to do this would be see which prediction output each model gave and the final prediction would be what the majority of the models output. However, this poses two possible issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What if 5 models say class A and 5 say class B? There wouldn’t be an odd number in this case to be the tie breaker&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one model is 99% sure that an image is class A but another model is only 50% sure that it’s class A, using the method described above would give each of these equal weights when it maybe shouldn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, I decided to take a step back and look at the probability outcomes that are used to determine each model’s final answer. Basically, the final layer of the model outputs two numbers: the probability that an image is one class or another. So what I did was I kept track of each of these probabilities and for each image, added up all the models’ class A probability and class B probability separately. The final answer would be whichever summed probability is higher. This way, the “confidence” of each of the 10 models is taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, that didn’t take me very long today, so when I tested the Adiantum/Blechnum model, we got a whooping &lt;span class=&quot;standOut&quot;&gt;97.8% accuracy!!&lt;/span&gt; It was tested on 400 new images and this is the best I’ve ever gotten :)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is good news because it means the model can work! We just need to tweak values and perhaps look at cleaning our input images for Lycopodium and Selaginella.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was mainly spent documenting my work. I explained to Matt how my Google Drive was organized and how to use Github as well as documented within the Drive where everything is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did, however, forget to upload my final cross-validation testing file to Github, which is what I’ll do first thing tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last day tomorrow! What a melancholy feeling…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Al&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday-august-30-2019&quot;&gt;Friday August 30, 2019&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was spent mainly double checking my documentation on Github and Google Drive. I called Beth and we went over each file in Github and she seems confident on where I’m leaving off, which is great! I’m so excited for her to continue this project and be able to run the model on a computer that has enough processing power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Matt worked on getting the images contrasted a bit more yesterday; now the background of the images are very white compared to the specimen in focus and it helped get rid of some noise. We only have a little less than 150 of either group, but we ran the model for 50 epochs and we actually got some results! Although overfitting still occurred, the validation accuracy definitely grew as the number of epochs increased! This is a great sign! It means the machine is able to generalize what it’s learning on the training data onto new images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we didn’t run for very long and we don’t have many images, we were able to start another run before the end of the day. Matt went through the images and deleted any that were actually the wrong specimen or weren’t sterile as this type of noise could be hurting the model’s performance. Then, before I left, I ran two models: one with the same exact specs as the last run, just with the new images, and one with the new images &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more epochs. Although I won’t be able to see the results, Matt will be able to check it out and report back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a wrap :) although I’m leaving, I know this project is going to go far in the hands of Beth, Matt, and Dr. Iacobelli. I’m excited to see where they are able to take this application of computer science into botany and am truly grateful for this opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;
